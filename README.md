# Front End Development

The follow projects below are in order from first project to nth project.

  ### 1. Fylo Project
This project is a challenge I took from a website called Frontend Mentor. The challenge required me to design a landing page for Desktop (width: 1440px) and Mobile (375px) sizes. Hence, I've accomplished this challenge by using:  HTML, CSS, and BootStrap 4.
